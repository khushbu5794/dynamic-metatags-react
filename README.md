**DynamicMetaTags-React-Node**
I'll talk about Adding Meta Tags Dynamically to React Apps Using a NodeJS Server. All social networking networks, including Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Whatsapp, and others, are compatible with the dynamic Meta tags.

The /home page, /about page, /post/:id pages, and /contact pages on your website project are examples of React app routes. The meta title, meta description, OG title, OG url, OG image, and other similar meta tags are all set on each of these pages.

A strong library called React Helmet aids in dynamically updating meta tags on the server. For React single page applications, management and SEO are simple.

The meta tags for a React app are all located in two places: the frontend using React Helmet tags and the backend using an express server.

**How do I use it?**

The first step is to create a react app and add the component to your project. The following command should be entered after opening your terminal.

`npx create-react-app my-app`

`cd my-app`

`npm start`

Next, React router and react helmet install the required packages using the npm command:

`npm install react-router-dom`

`npm i react-helmet`

**if you run some problem while project testing because of local caching and new server request is problem every time. Try a new incognito window or clear browser history for testing.**
